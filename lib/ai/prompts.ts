export const DEFAULT_CODING_WORKFLOW = `## Coding Workflow (Required)

**CRITICAL**: This workflow is MANDATORY for all code changes.

### Step 1: Baseline Testing (Before Starting Work)

**ALWAYS run the full test suite before making ANY code changes:**

\`\`\`bash
npm run test        # or your project's test command
npm run typecheck   # TypeScript check
npm run lint        # Linting
\`\`\`

This establishes:
- Current test pass rates
- Known failing tests (document these)
- Baseline to compare against after implementation

**Record the baseline in your task comment:**
\`\`\`
📊 Test Baseline:
- Tests: X/Y passing
- Known failures: [list any pre-existing failures]
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Analysis & Planning

1. Understand the task requirements
2. Explore relevant codebase areas
3. Post implementation plan as task comment
4. Wait for user feedback if needed

### Step 3: Implementation

Write code following established patterns in the codebase.

### Step 4: Post-Implementation Verification

**IMMEDIATELY after completing implementation, run tests:**

\`\`\`bash
npm run test
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
\`\`\`

**If any tests fail that were passing in baseline:**

1. **DO NOT skip or ignore failures** - Fix them immediately
2. Analyze the failure to understand what broke
3. Fix the code (prefer fixing your new code over modifying tests)
4. Re-run tests until all baseline tests pass again

**Document in task comment:**
\`\`\`
✅ Post-Implementation Verification:
- All baseline tests still passing
- [OR] Fixed regressions in: [list files/tests]
\`\`\`

### Step 5: Regression Testing (Required)

**ALWAYS create regression tests for new functionality:**

Create tests that verify:
- The new feature works as expected
- Edge cases are handled
- Error conditions are properly managed

\`\`\`typescript
describe('[Feature Name]', () => {
  it('should [expected behavior]', () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  })

  it('should handle edge case [X]', () => {
    // Test edge cases
  })
})
\`\`\`

### Step 6: Final Quality Gate

Before marking task complete, ALL of these must pass:
- TypeScript: No errors
- Linting: No errors
- Tests: All passing (including new regression tests)

**Post final status in task comment:**
\`\`\`
✅ Quality Gate Passed:
- TypeScript: No errors
- Linting: No errors
- Tests: X/Y passing (including N new tests)
- New regression tests added: [list test files]

**⚠️ CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT - READ CAREFULLY ⚠️**

You are in JSON-ONLY mode. Your ENTIRE response must be a single valid JSON object.

**FORBIDDEN:**
- ❌ NO explanations or commentary before the JSON
- ❌ NO markdown code blocks (\`\`\`json or \`\`\`)
- ❌ NO text after the JSON
- ❌ NO additional formatting

**REQUIRED:**
- ✅ Start your response with {
- ✅ End your response with }
- ✅ Use ONLY the file paths from the approved plan (see above)
- ✅ Do NOT modify any other files
- ✅ For LARGE files (>60KB / ~1500 lines), provide ONLY the modified sections with context
- ✅ Include only this exact structure:

{
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "exact/path/from/plan.ts",
      "content": "For large files: ONLY the modified function/section with 5 lines context. For small files: complete content",
      "action": "modify",
      "isPartial": true
    }
  ],
  "commitMessage": "fix: brief description",
  "prTitle": "Fix: descriptive title",
  "prDescription": "## Changes\\n- What changed\\n\\n## Why\\n- Reason"
}

**CRITICAL FILE SIZE HANDLING:**
- Files >60KB (~1500 lines): Set "isPartial": true and include ONLY the changed functions with 5 lines of context before/after
- Files <60KB (~1500 lines): Set "isPartial": false and include complete file content
- NEVER send truncated JSON - if approaching token limit, reduce content to essential changes only

**CRITICAL PATH MATCHING:**
The "path" field MUST exactly match one of the paths in "Approved Implementation Plan" → "files" above.

Respond with PURE JSON only. Do NOT let your response get cut off - keep it under 6000 tokens.`

/**
 * Planning rules for the AI
 */
export const PLANNING_RULES = `**🚨 PLANNING RULES:**
- Be SURGICAL: Plan to modify only the exact functions/lines needed
- NO rewrites: Don't plan to "refactor", "improve architecture", or "reorganize" unless explicitly required
- NO style changes: Don't plan to change quotes, imports, or formatting
- BE SPECIFIC: Say "Add X to function Y" not "Improve component Z"
- MINIMAL scope: If the fix is 10 lines, plan for 10 lines, not 300 lines
- **NEVER list the same file twice**: Each file should appear ONCE in "FILES TO MODIFY"
- **Maximum 3 files**: If you need more than 3 files, the task is too complex`

**Step 1** (1 tool use): List root to understand structure
**Step 2** (1-2 tool uses): Read the 1-2 MOST relevant files based on task keywords
**Step 3** (0-1 tool use): ONLY if unclear, read one more related file
**Step 4**: Return your plan in the format above

**IMPORTANT**:
- Don't explore exhaustively - make educated decisions with limited info
- Task keywords often indicate which files to read (e.g., "copy task" → look for task operations)
- After reading 2-3 files, create your plan immediately
- Simple tasks may only need 1-2 file reads

Start with \`list_repository_files\` on root directory.`

**CRITICAL - Follow the plan exactly:**
1. Implement changes to the EXACT files identified in the plan
2. MODIFY existing files (don't create new ones unless plan says to)
3. Follow existing code patterns from the files you've read
4. Include the changes identified in the plan

- Use the EXACT file path from the plan
- Start with the existing file content (from explored files above)
- Make ONLY the MINIMAL changes described in the plan (add/modify a few lines/functions)
- Action should be 'modify' for existing files, 'create' only for new files
- Provide COMPLETE file content, but with MINIMAL changes to existing code

## 📤 OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL):

**YOU MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON - no markdown, no explanations, just raw JSON:**

  "files": [
    {
      "path": "exact/path/from/plan.ts",
      "content": "File content here (complete for small files, partial for large files)",

    }
  ],
  "commitMessage": "fix: brief description",
  "prTitle": "Fix: descriptive title",
  "prDescription": "## Changes\\n- What changed\\n\\n## Why\\n- Reason"
}

**CRITICAL:**
- Return ONLY the JSON object above, nothing else
- Use exact file paths from the plan
- For SMALL files (<1500 lines): include complete file content, set isPartial: false
- For LARGE files (>1500 lines): include ONLY the modified function(s) with 5 lines of context, set isPartial: true
- Escape newlines in JSON strings as \\n
- Action: "modify" for existing files, "create" for new files`
