# Email Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up email delivery for your task management application using Resend or other email services.

## Current Setup

The application uses a **dual email system**:
- **Cloudflare Email Routing**: For receiving emails (e.g., `remindme@astrid.cc`)
- **Resend**: For sending emails (verification, invitations, reminders)

> **New**: For complete Cloudflare + Resend setup, see [CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL_SETUP.md](./CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL_SETUP.md)

## Environment Variables Required

Add these variables to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Resend Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your-resend-api-key-here"
FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"

# These should already be set
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # or your production URL
NODE_ENV="development"  # or "production"
```

## Resend Setup (Recommended)

### 1. Create a Resend Account
- Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
- Sign up for a free account
- Free tier includes 3,000 emails/month

### 2. Get Your API Key
- In your Resend dashboard, go to "API Keys"
- Click "Create API Key"
- Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

### 3. Verify Your Domain (Production)
For production, you'll need to verify your sending domain:
- Go to "Domains" in Resend dashboard
- Add your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
- Follow DNS setup instructions
- Use verified domain in `FROM_EMAIL` (e.g., `noreply@yourdomain.com`)

### 4. Set Environment Variables
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_actual_api_key_here"
FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"  # Use your verified domain
```

## Alternative Email Services

The code can be easily adapted for other services:

### SendGrid
```bash
SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG.your-sendgrid-key"
FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"
```

### Mailgun
```bash
MAILGUN_API_KEY="your-mailgun-key"
MAILGUN_DOMAIN="yourdomain.com"
FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"
```

## Email Types Sent

The application sends these types of emails:

### 1. **Task Assignment Invitations**
- Sent when assigning tasks to new users
- Contains invitation link to join the platform
- Expires in 7 days

### 2. **Email Verification**
- Sent when users verify their email address
- Sent when users change their email address
- Expires in 24 hours

### 3. **List Sharing Invitations**
- Sent when sharing task lists with other users
- Contains invitation link to join the list
- Expires in 7 days

## Development vs Production

### Development Mode
- `NODE_ENV="development"` OR missing `RESEND_API_KEY`
- Emails are logged to console instead of sent
- No actual email delivery
- Perfect for testing

### Production Mode
- `NODE_ENV="production"` AND `RESEND_API_KEY` is set
- Emails are sent via Resend
- Requires verified domain for deliverability

## Testing Email Delivery

### 1. Development Testing
```bash
# Set in .env.local
NODE_ENV="development"
```
Check your console for email logs when triggering email actions.

### 2. Production Testing
```bash
# Set in .env.local
NODE_ENV="production"
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_test_key"
FROM_EMAIL="test@yourverifieddomain.com"
```

## Email Templates

The application includes professional email templates:

- **HTML templates** with modern styling
- **Plain text fallbacks** for compatibility
- **Responsive design** for mobile devices
- **Clear call-to-action buttons**
- **Security warnings** for sensitive actions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emails not sending in production**
   - Check `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly
   - Verify `FROM_EMAIL` uses a verified domain
   - Check Resend dashboard for errors

2. **Domain verification issues**
   - Ensure DNS records are set correctly
   - Wait for DNS propagation (up to 24 hours)
   - Check domain status in Resend dashboard

3. **High bounce rates**
   - Use a verified domain for `FROM_EMAIL`
   - Avoid spam-trigger words in subject lines
   - Include unsubscribe links (Resend adds automatically)

### Debugging

Enable detailed logging by checking your server logs when emails are sent. The application logs:
- Email send attempts
- Resend API responses
- Error messages with details

## Cost Considerations

### Resend Pricing (as of 2024)
- **Free tier**: 3,000 emails/month
- **Pro tier**: $20/month for 50,000 emails
- **Excellent deliverability** and developer experience

### Volume Estimates
For a typical task management app:
- **Small team (10 users)**: ~100-500 emails/month
- **Medium team (50 users)**: ~500-2,000 emails/month
- **Large team (200 users)**: ~2,000-8,000 emails/month

Most teams will stay within the free tier limits.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keep API keys secure**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables
   - Rotate keys periodically

2. **Use verified domains**
   - Improves deliverability
   - Reduces spam flags
   - Builds user trust

3. **Monitor email delivery**
   - Check Resend dashboard for bounces
   - Monitor unsubscribe rates
   - Watch for spam complaints

## Next Steps

1. Set up your Resend account
2. Verify your domain
3. Add environment variables
4. Test email delivery
5. Monitor performance in production
