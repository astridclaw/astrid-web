# Vercel Deployment via GitHub Actions

This document explains how Astrid deploys to Vercel using GitHub Actions workflows instead of Vercel's automatic Git integration.

## Why GitHub Actions Instead of Vercel Git Integration?

**Problem:** Vercel's automatic Git integration tries to deploy commits from all contributors, including automated agents. When commits are authored by `ai-agent@astrid.cc` (an email without a Vercel account), Vercel blocks the deployment with:

```
The git deployment is blocked due to insufficient permissions.
The github user ai-agent@astrid.cc does not have an account on Vercel.
```

**Solution:** We disable Vercel's Git integration and use GitHub Actions workflows to control all deployments. These workflows use a Vercel service token (`VERCEL_TOKEN`) that has proper permissions, bypassing the user authentication issue.

## Architecture

### Deployment Flow

```
Code Push → GitHub → GitHub Actions → Vercel CLI → Vercel Deployment
```

### Key Components

1. **GitHub Actions Workflows** (`.github/workflows/`)
   - `production-deployment.yml` - Deploys to production
   - `preview-deployment.yml` - Creates preview deployments for PRs (with custom `*.astrid.cc` aliases)

2. **Vercel CLI** - Used by workflows to deploy via service token
3. **Vercel Service Token** - Stored in GitHub secrets as `VERCEL_TOKEN`

## Setup Instructions

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

Run the automated setup script:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
brew install gh
gh auth login

# Run the setup script
npm run setup:github-secrets
```

This script will configure all required GitHub secrets automatically.

### Manual Setup

#### 1. Disable Vercel's Automatic Git Integration

This is a **critical step** to prevent the "insufficient permissions" error:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Git**
3. Find the section for **Git Integration** or **Automatic Deployments**
4. **Disable** or **Disconnect** the Git integration
5. Save the changes

**Result:** Vercel will no longer try to automatically deploy on git pushes. All deployments will be controlled by GitHub Actions.

#### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets

The following secrets are required in your GitHub repository (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

##### Vercel Configuration (Pre-configured values)

| Secret Name | Value | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | *(your token)* | Service token from Vercel |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | `team_gFxp7fWaX7e8tUPt8Vt3YXl0` | Jon Paris' projects team ID |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | `prj_MUWxfWJ9lIZOi2clHPZhlHsYqSiy` | Production (astrid.cc) |
| `VERCEL_TEAM_ID` | `team_gFxp7fWaX7e8tUPt8Vt3YXl0` | Same as ORG_ID |

##### Database Configuration

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Production database URL (from .env.local `DATABASE_URL_PROD`) |

##### Astrid Integration (for AI Agent)

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `ASTRID_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth client ID from astrid.cc |
| `ASTRID_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth client secret |
| `ASTRID_MCP_TOKEN` | MCP token for AI agent authentication |

#### 3. Create Vercel Service Token

1. Go to [Vercel Account Settings → Tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
2. Click **Create Token**
3. Name it something descriptive like "GitHub Actions Deployment"
4. Select the appropriate scope:
   - **Full Access** (recommended for automated deployments)
   - Or limit to specific projects
5. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)
6. Add it to GitHub secrets as `VERCEL_TOKEN`

### 4. Verify Workflow Configuration

Check that your workflows have proper git configuration for any steps that create commits:

```yaml
- name: Auto-commit fixes
  run: |
    git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
    git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"

    # Your commit logic here
```

**Important:** Never use `ai-agent@astrid.cc` or any email without a Vercel account as the git committer in workflows that trigger deployments.

## Triggering Deployments

### From Local CLI (Command Line)

```bash
# Deploy to production (pushes to main, auto-triggers workflow)
npm run deploy:production

# Trigger any workflow manually
npm run deploy:trigger production    # Production deployment
npm run deploy:trigger preview       # Preview deployment
npm run deploy:trigger ai-agent --task-id <taskId>  # AI agent workflow
npm run deploy:trigger monitor       # Run deployment monitoring
```

### From Cloud AI Agent (astrid.cc)

The Astrid AI Coding Agent at `astrid.cc/settings/coding-integration` can trigger deployments via:

1. **Automatic PR Previews**: When the AI creates a PR, the `preview-deployment.yml` workflow automatically creates a preview URL
2. **Production Deployment**: When a PR is merged to main, `production-deployment.yml` triggers
3. **Manual Trigger**: The AI agent can trigger workflows via the `repository_dispatch` event

The cloud agent uses the `ASTRID_MCP_TOKEN` secret to authenticate and the workflows communicate back via webhooks to update task status.

### From GitHub UI

1. Go to [Actions](https://github.com/Graceful-Tools/astrid-res-www/actions)
2. Select the workflow you want to run
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Configure options if needed
5. Click "Run workflow"

## Deployment Workflows

### Production Deployment

**File:** `.github/workflows/production-deployment.yml`

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull request merged to `main`
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Steps:**
1. Quality gates (tests, linting, typecheck)
2. Database migrations
3. Deploy to Vercel production
4. Health checks
5. Update AI tasks (if applicable)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Automatic: push to main
git push origin main

# Manual via npm script
npm run deploy:production

# Manual via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run production-deployment.yml
```

### Preview Deployment

**File:** `.github/workflows/preview-deployment.yml`

**Triggers:**
- Pull request opened/updated
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose:** Creates preview deployments with custom `*.astrid.cc` aliases (e.g., `feature-xyz.astrid.cc`) for testing PRs before merging. Preview URLs are automatically posted to task comments.

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Check Deployment Status

**GitHub Actions:**
```bash
# View recent workflow runs
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions

# View specific workflow
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions/workflows/production-deployment.yml
```

**Vercel Dashboard:**
```bash
# View deployment history
https://vercel.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PROJECT/deployments
```

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Insufficient permissions" error from Vercel

**Cause:** Vercel's Git integration is still enabled and trying to deploy automatically.

**Fix:**
1. Disable Vercel Git integration (see Setup step 1)
2. Ensure GitHub Actions workflows are using `VERCEL_TOKEN`

#### Issue: GitHub Actions workflows failing with authentication errors

**Cause:** `VERCEL_TOKEN` is missing, invalid, or expired.

**Fix:**
1. Regenerate token in Vercel → Account Settings → Tokens
2. Update `VERCEL_TOKEN` in GitHub secrets
3. Re-run the workflow

#### Issue: Deployments succeeding but not showing in Vercel

**Cause:** Wrong `VERCEL_ORG_ID` or `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`.

**Fix:**
1. Verify IDs in Vercel project settings
2. Update GitHub secrets with correct IDs
3. Re-run the workflow

#### Issue: Database migrations failing

**Cause:** `DATABASE_URL` not set or incorrect.

**Fix:**
1. Verify database URL in Vercel environment variables
2. Add `DATABASE_URL` to GitHub secrets
3. Re-run the workflow

### Debugging Tips

**View detailed workflow logs:**
```bash
# Go to Actions tab in GitHub
# Click on the workflow run
# Click on individual job to see detailed logs
```

**Test Vercel CLI authentication locally:**
```bash
export VERCEL_TOKEN="your-token-here"
vercel whoami --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN
```

**Check Vercel deployment logs:**
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard, click on deployment
# View "Logs" tab for build and runtime logs
```

## Git Committer Identity

### Why This Matters

When commits are pushed to GitHub, Vercel (if Git integration is enabled) checks the committer's email against Vercel user accounts. If the email doesn't have a Vercel account, deployments are blocked.

### Best Practices

**Use GitHub Actions bot identity:**
```yaml
git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
```

or

```yaml
git config --local user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
git config --local user.name "github-actions[bot]"
```

**Don't use:**
```yaml
# AVOID: Email without Vercel account
git config --local user.email "ai-agent@astrid.cc"
```

### Current Workflow Configuration

Our workflows use proper git configuration:

- `monitor-deployments.yml:181-182` - Uses `action@github.com` ✅
- Other workflows don't create commits, so no configuration needed ✅

## Maintenance

### Rotating Vercel Token

Periodically rotate the `VERCEL_TOKEN` for security:

1. Create new token in Vercel dashboard
2. Update `VERCEL_TOKEN` in GitHub secrets
3. Test deployments work with new token
4. Revoke old token in Vercel dashboard

### Updating Workflows

When modifying deployment workflows:

1. Test changes on a feature branch first
2. Use `workflow_dispatch` to manually trigger and test
3. Monitor deployment logs carefully
4. Verify health checks pass

### Adding New Environments

To add a new environment (e.g., "development"):

1. Create new Vercel project or environment
2. Get project ID from Vercel settings
3. Add `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_DEVELOPMENT` to GitHub secrets
4. Copy and modify existing workflow file
5. Update environment variables in workflow

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management

- **Never** commit tokens or secrets to git
- Use GitHub's encrypted secrets feature
- Rotate tokens regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- Use least-privilege tokens (limit to specific projects)

### Access Control

- Limit GitHub Actions permissions to necessary scopes
- Review workflow permissions regularly
- Use `GITHUB_TOKEN` with minimal permissions
- Require PR reviews before merging to `main`

### Audit Trail

- All deployments are logged in GitHub Actions
- Vercel maintains deployment history
- Use commit messages to track changes
- Tag production releases for easy rollback

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback via Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to Vercel project → Deployments
2. Find the last known good deployment
3. Click "..." → "Promote to Production"

### Rollback via Git

```bash
# Find the commit to roll back to
git log --oneline

# Create rollback commit
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Or reset to previous commit (use with caution)
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git push --force origin main
```

### Rollback via GitHub Actions

Use manual workflow dispatch to redeploy a specific commit:

1. Go to Actions → Production Deployment
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select the branch/tag to deploy
4. Run workflow
