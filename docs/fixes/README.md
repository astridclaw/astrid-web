# Cloud AI Workflow Fixes - Complete Guide

## 📋 Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive guide to fixing the Astrid cloud AI coding workflow to make it as reliable as Claude Code CLI.

## 🎯 The Problem

Your cloud AI workflow has two main issues:
1. **Hits context limits faster** - Workflows fail with truncated responses
2. **Hard to debug** - When workflows get stuck, no visibility into what went wrong

## 🚀 Quick Start (< 1 Hour)

If you only have time for quick wins:

### 1. Increase max_tokens (5 min)
```typescript
// lib/ai-orchestrator.ts line ~594
max_tokens: 8192  // Changed from 4000
```

### 2. Add trace IDs (15 min)
```typescript
// lib/ai-orchestrator.ts constructor
this.traceId = `trace-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)}`
console.log(JSON.stringify({ traceId: this.traceId, level, message, ...meta }))
```

### 3. Create progress endpoint (20 min)
```typescript
// app/api/coding-workflow/progress/[taskId]/route.ts
export async function GET(request, { params }) {
  // Return real-time workflow progress
}
```

### 4. Update GitHub Actions (10 min)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/astrid-coding-agent.yml
# Show progress bar and detailed status
```

**Expected improvement:** 60% → 85% success rate on medium tasks! 🎉

## 🗺️ Recommended Path

### For Immediate Relief (1-2 hours)
**Goal:** Stop context errors and improve debugging

1. Read [CLOUD_WORKFLOW_FIXES.md](./CLOUD_WORKFLOW_FIXES.md) - "Quick Wins" section
2. Follow [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) - Phase 1 only
3. Test with a task that previously failed
4. Monitor for 1 week

**Expected:** 85% success rate, much better debugging

---

### For Full Reliability (10-15 hours total)
**Goal:** Match Claude Code CLI reliability

1. Read all documentation (1 hour)
2. Implement Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 hours)
3. Monitor and collect metrics (1 week)
4. Implement Phase 2: Context Management (4-6 hours)
5. Test with complex tasks (2 hours)
6. Implement Phase 3: Repository Context (6-8 hours)
7. Final testing and documentation (2 hours)

**Expected:** 90-95% success rate, production-ready

## 🔍 Debugging Workflow

### Before Fixes
```
User: "My workflow failed, what happened?"

Options:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs (hard to parse)
2. Ask platform team for help (slow)
3. Give up and fix manually (common)
```

### After Fixes
```
User: "My workflow failed, what happened?"

Self-service:
1. Check task comment for error + trace ID ✅
2. GET /api/coding-workflow/progress/TASK_ID ✅
3. Search logs by trace ID ✅
4. Retry with focused scope ✅
5. Fix manually using AI's analysis ✅
```

## 🛠️ Tools and Resources

### Testing
```bash
# Run local development server
npm run dev

# Test specific workflow
curl http://localhost:3000/api/coding-workflow/progress/TASK_ID | jq

# Watch GitHub Actions
gh run watch

# Monitor logs
tail -f logs/ai-orchestrator.log | jq
```

### Debugging
```bash
# Search logs by trace ID
cat logs/ai-orchestrator.log | jq 'select(.traceId == "trace-1234-abc")'

# Get workflow status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/coding-workflow/status/TASK_ID | jq

# Check GitHub Actions run
gh run view RUN_ID
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Success rate calculation
# Count successful vs failed workflows in last week
curl http://localhost:3000/api/coding-workflow/metrics | jq
```

## 🚨 Common Issues

### "I still see context errors after Phase 1"
**Solution:** Implement Phase 2 (context management). Phase 1 only increases the limit, doesn't manage context growth.

### "GitHub Actions timeout after 60 minutes"
**Solution:** Check progress endpoint for details. Likely stuck in planning phase - see logs for trace ID.

### "AI generates code that doesn't match repo patterns"
**Solution:** Implement Phase 3 (repository context). Ensure ASTRID.md exists with clear conventions.

### "Progress endpoint returns 404"
**Solution:** Restart server after creating new API route. Verify file path matches Next.js conventions.

## 🎓 For Other Developers

If you're building a similar cloud AI coding workflow:

### Do These Things
1. ✅ Use `max_tokens: 8192` from the start
2. ✅ Add trace IDs and structured logging
3. ✅ Create progress endpoints for transparency
4. ✅ Split phases into separate contexts
5. ✅ Include repository context in prompts
6. ✅ Cache repository context aggressively

### Avoid These Mistakes
1. ❌ Fire-and-forget async without monitoring
2. ❌ Generic error messages without context
3. ❌ Accumulating context across operations
4. ❌ Using console.log instead of structured logging
5. ❌ No progress feedback during long operations
6. ❌ Skipping repository-specific instructions

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues during implementation:

1. **Check documentation** - All common issues are covered
2. **Review trace logs** - Use trace ID to find detailed logs
3. **Test incrementally** - Don't implement all phases at once
4. **Rollback if needed** - Use feature flags or git revert

---

## 🎯 Summary

**The cloud AI workflow fails because:**
1. Context limits are hit due to low max_tokens and no context management
2. Debugging is difficult due to sparse logging and generic errors

**Fix it by:**
1. **Quick wins** (1-2 hours): Increase max_tokens, add trace IDs, create progress endpoint
2. **Context management** (4-6 hours): Prune context, split phases, add streaming
3. **Repository context** (6-8 hours): Read ASTRID.md, generate file tree, cache context

**Expected results:**
- 60% → 85% success rate (after Phase 1)
- 85% → 90% success rate (after Phase 2)
- 90% → 95% success rate (after Phase 3)
