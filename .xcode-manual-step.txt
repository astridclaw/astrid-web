🚨 MANUAL STEP REQUIRED: Add GitHubRepository.swift to Xcode Project

## Root Cause of Build Error

The file GitHubRepository.swift exists in the filesystem but is NOT added to the Xcode project.
This causes ListAdminTab.swift to fail compilation with:
"trailing closure passed to parameter of type 'FormStyleConfiguration'"

The Form error is a CASCADING error from GitHubRepository type not being found.

## How to Fix

1. Open Xcode: ios-app/Astrid App.xcodeproj
2. In the Project Navigator, right-click on "Astrid App/Models" folder
3. Select "Add Files to 'Astrid App'..."
4. Navigate to: ios-app/Astrid App/Models/GitHubRepository.swift
5. Make sure "Copy items if needed" is UNCHECKED (file is already in correct location)
6. Make sure "Astrid App" target is CHECKED
7. Click "Add"
8. Clean build folder (⇧⌘K)
9. Build (⌘B)

## Verification

After adding the file, the build should succeed. The file contains:
- struct GitHubRepository
- struct GitHubRepositoriesResponse
- struct GitHubStatusResponse

File location: ios-app/Astrid App/Models/GitHubRepository.swift
